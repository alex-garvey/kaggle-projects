## Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself
### Description:
#### "A GAN consists of at least two neural networks: a generator model and a discriminator model. The generator is a neural network that creates the images. For our competition, you should generate images in the style of Monet."
### Steps followed:
#### 1) Research GAN best practices
#### 2) Implement best practices into DCGAN used to generate Monet-style images.
#### 3) Build and train the model
#### 4) Play with model to see how suggestions improve or hurt the final results.
